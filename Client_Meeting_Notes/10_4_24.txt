Questions leading into this meeting are (prior to the meeting):
1. How can we SSH into an EC2 instance for which we didn't generate a key-value pair?
2. Should we create a security group with rules explicitly defined for SSH and HTTP?
3. What functionalities do IAM and SSM provide us when interacting with the instances?
4. Do we clone the github repo via git commands from python?

Meeting notes (during the meeting):
1. We don't need to create rules explicitly defined for SSH and HTTP because the default security group already accepts connections from any IP address
2. When we don't have a key-value pair, we can access an EC2 instance by defining an IAM role for it and then creating a new session with SSM
3. Priorities would be:
      a. Working on creating an EC2 instance that is able to run Python to host our APIs
      b. Test the functionality of the APIs when calling them with an HTTP route.
      d. Figuring out terraform since we've already explored AWS CLI as a way to interact with the ec2 instances.
      e. Start thinking about performance tests.

Other notes of importance and lingering questions (after the meeting):
      a. Connecting to an EC2 instance by creating a new session with SSM is the safest way to interact with an instance
      b. Creating a new session with SSM is a method for connecting to an EC2 instance without a key-value pair
      c. How can we send?
            c_i. Can we SSH into the instance and use sftp for file transferring?
            c_ii. You mentioned using either gitlab or github (can we get a clarification because we forgot to note it down). And if we were to use github, would be just clone the repo onto the instance after ssh-ing in to the localstack instance.
            c_iii. How can we install python in the localstack EC2 instance?
