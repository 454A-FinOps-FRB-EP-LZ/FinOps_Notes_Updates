Questions leading into this meeting are (prior to the meeting):
1. How can we SSH into an EC2 instance for which we didn't generate a key-value pair?
2. Should we create a security group with rules explicitly defined for SSH and HTTP?
3. What functionalities do IAM and SSM provide us when interacting with the instances?
4. Do we clone the github repo via git commands from python?

Meeting notes (during the meeting):
1. We don't need to create rules explicitly defined for SSH and HTTP because the default security group already accepts connections from any IP address
2. When we don't have a key-value pair, we can access an EC2 instance by defining an IAM role for it and then creating a new session with SSM
3. Priorities would be:
      a. Working on creating an EC2 instance that is able to run Python to host our APIs
      b. Test the functionality of the APIs when calling them with an HTTP route.
      c. Figuring out terraform since we've already explored AWS CLI as a way to interact with the ec2 instances.
      d. Start thinking about performance tests.

Other notes of importance and lingering questions (after the meeting):
      a. Connecting to an EC2 instance by creating a new session with SSM is the safest way to interact with an instance
      b. Creating a new session with SSM is a method for connecting to an EC2 instance without a key-value pair
      c. How can we send our Python files to the EC2 instance?
            c_i. Is there a way to set up an SFTP file transfer through SSM?
            c_ii. Would cloning our GitHub repository in the home directory work through SSM?
            c_iii. How can we set up SFTP without defining a key pair?
            c_iv. What tool would we use for doing SFTP--Filezilla or vs code SFTP extension?
