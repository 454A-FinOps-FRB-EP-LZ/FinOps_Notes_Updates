Questions leading into this meeting are (prior to the meeting):
1. What is docker / what are containers?
2. How to set up localstack (ec2 cluster, scaling)?
3. What are the built in libraries used for cpu manipulation in python?
4. What are the differences between using ec2 and lambda for the project?
5. What are the differences between the UI, CLI, and Terraform?

Meeting notes (during the meeting):
1. Docker is a good way to leverage code to create an image of operating systems. (Justin uses docker to run linux on a windows computer--similar to a vm)
2. Priorities would be:
      a. Figuring out AWS CLI with localstack as this is a step in between the local stack UI and using terraform.
      b. Set up an EC2 cluster with AWS CLI.
      c. Read into the multiprocessing & os python libraries.
      d. Make more progress on the flask REST APIs.

Other notes of importance and lingering questions (after the meeting): 
      a. EC2 is used over lambda because lambda hides the scaling policies by applying them automatically.
      b. Create two EC2 clusters one for each API (one cluster for CPU testing, one cluster for memory testing).
      c. How do we put our code files onto the EC2 instance?
            c_i. Can we SSH into the instance and use sftp for file transferring?
            c_ii. You mentioned using either gitlab or github (can we get a clarification because we forgot to note it down). And if we were to use github, would be just clone the repo onto the instance after ssh-ing in to the localstack instance.
            c_iii. How can we install python in the localstack EC2 instance?
